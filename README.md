<h3 align="center">Decentralized Ride Service</h3>

<div align="center">
  <h3> Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>In most of the cities which have a wide local auto and taxi network deny ola and uber to enter that town/city/place. As drivers fear of slavery and reduced income, losing ownership and independence.</p>

------------------------------------------
### Solution

- `Decentralization` This platform will remove the centralized transaction fee (payment gateway)and also the platform fee (uber or ola) and allows drivers and commuters to register directly. 
- `Transparency` When a user request cab for a trip, drivers nearby will be notified with the trip and they can start bidding, the user can choose the least bid and start the ride, having a Local Fare Estimator will really help people who are new to the city and can avoid being cheated.
- Drivers need not pay commissions to Cab hailing platforms
- Users need not pay high surge prices
- Tax grip for govt

------------------------------------------
### Issues

 - `Bargaining with Cab Drver's` Users find it timeconsuming and useless to bargain for reducing the prices quoted by normal cab or auto wala (High prices are quoted because their business is hindered by ola and uber so they try to make as much money as possible in one single ride).
 - `Decentralized Payments` Users are more satisfied with digital payments rather than cash along with the partner offers delivered to a user.
 - `Cheat on Fares` Native ppl know better insights about fares of their own states and places. But a guy from other state visiting Kerala will have no idea about the local fares but will prefer ola and uber for a nominal price.
 - `Transparency for Govt.` As and when many country's local Govt. are asking Ola and Uber to comply with local rules which might hinder their earnings and net profit. After a few years, the prices may be the same or more than the local taxi vendors.
